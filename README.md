* Question no 1 : A 3-sequence of A,B,C is made by selecting 3 characters from the set. Repetation
allowed. Using nested loops to print the possible 27 sequence of A,B,C by new lines.
```
For Example: 
AAA
AAB
AAC
ABC
ABA
```
Solution: [Question no1](https://github.com/sujonict07/FunWithC/blob/master/possibleSequence.cpp).



* Question no 2 : Give a positive Integer, n, from the user. Write a program that prints that many 
triangles of asterisks starting with the triangle of size 2.
```
Sample Example 
input : n = 3 : 
Output:
*
**
*
**
***
*
**
***
****
```
Solution: [Question no2](https://github.com/sujonict07/FunWithC/blob/master/manyTriangleWithNewLine/manyTriangleWithNewLine.cpp).


* Question no 3 : Give a positive Integer, n, from the user. Write a program that prints that many 
triangles of asterisks starting with the triangle with (n+1) rows. Each Triangle has one less row.
```
Sample Example 
input : n = 4
Output:
*   
**   * 
***  **  *

Solution: [Question no3](https://github.com/sujonict07/FunWithC/blob/master/manyTriangleWithNewLine/problem_no_3.cpp).

* Question no 4 : Give a positive Integer, n, from the user. Write a program that prints that many 
triangles of asterisks starting with the triangle with (n+1) rows. Each Triangle has one less row.
```
Sample Example 
input : n = 4
Output:
             *   
        *   **    
    *  **  ***
 * ** *** ****

```
Solution: [Question no4](https://github.com/sujonict07/FunWithC/blob/master/manyTriangleWithNewLine/problem_no_4.cpp).


* Question no 5 : Give a positive Integer, n, from the user. Make a triangle with many rows of asterisks.
```
Sample Example 
input : n = 4
Output:
